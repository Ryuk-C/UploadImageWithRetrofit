In this project, I uploaded an image to the server using retrofit. Before the images are uploaded to the server, the image size(MB) is reduced and uploaded by compressing them.

Libraries Used
--------------
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  * [Lifecycles][11] - Create a UI that automatically responds to lifecycle events.
  * [ViewModel][13] - Easily schedule asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
  * [LiveData][14] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.

* Third party and miscellaneous libraries
  * [Retrofit][30] for turns your HTTP API into a Java interface
  * [Kotlin Coroutines][34] A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
  * [Gson][31] for convert Java Objects into their JSON representation
  * [Hilt][32] for [dependency injection][33]
  * [Compressor][35] Compressor is a lightweight and powerful android image compression library.
  * [Lottie][36] Lottie is a mobile library for Android and iOS that parses Adobe After Effects animations exported as json renders them natively on mobile!
  

Architecture
--------------
The app uses [MVVM architecture][10] to have a unidirectional live of data, separation of concern, testability, and a lot more.
